jquery.abc
==========

turn images into ASCII art -> `$('img#boring').abc();` => **BOOOOOM!**

Demos here: **[image](http://frederikring.com/abc/)** and **[video](http://frederikring.com/abc/video.html)**

You could also **[use it with your webcam](http://frederikring.com/asciicam/)** (highly experimental - needs browser with `getUserMedia()` support!!)

**BETA AS BETA CAN BE** use at your own risk.
