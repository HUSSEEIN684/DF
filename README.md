jquery.abc
==========

turn images into ASCII art -> `$('img#boring').abc();` => **BOOOOOM!**

Demos here: **[image](http://m90.github.io/jquery.abc/image/)** and **[video](http://m90.github.io/jquery.abc/video/)**

You could also **[use it with your webcam](http://m90.github.io/jquery.abc/asciicam/)** (highly experimental - needs browser with `getUserMedia()` support!!)

**BETA AS BETA CAN BE** use at your own risk.
